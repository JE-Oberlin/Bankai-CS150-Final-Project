# Documentation
### Due: Saturday, January 22 @ 4:00PM

This file will contain your project Documentation. Fill out the relevant sections to document your code.

## Summary
#### Briefly describe your program and what it does.
Vidya Game

## Example Usage
#### Provide examples of how the user should run your program.
Click the replit run button OR type "python3 main.py" in the shell

## Input
#### Describe any input(s) required from the user.
Clicking the buttons that are displayed onscreen

## Output
#### Describe any output(s) produced by your program.
The text box at the bottom of the pygame window will display dialogue of the characters and feedback to the user during the battle phase.

## Known Issues
#### Describe any known bugs, including workarounds to keep your program running.
Sound does not work in replit so if you care enough you can download the files and run it in vscode or just in cmd or terminal. Make sure to run main.py
If you don't have pygame installed you can get it by running

```python -m pip install pygame```

or

```python3 -m pip install pygame```

depending on how you have python set up. For some reason my python launches a more updated version than the python3 command which I don't understand.
