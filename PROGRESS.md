# Progress Report
### Due: Tuesday, January 11 @ 11:59PM

This file will contain your Progress Report. Answer the prompts below to evaluate how well you were able to meet your intermediate goal(s).

### In a numbered list, briefly restate the intermediate goal(s) from your Project Proposal.
Going off of feedback, going to just focus on game mechanics with only 1 enemy, Aizen. 
1. Getting a VERY basic UI, just buttons that do stuff.
2. Way of progressing through dialgoue and triggering fights 
when fights are needed.

### Which goal(s) were you able to acheieve?
1/5: Buttons work, only hard part is now writing the fucntions that execute
when you click the button.
1/11: Having trouble putting together the system that interacts 
the two characters. I like have what's needed in my head but 
when I try to write it out I just stop thinking lol.

But the characters I want to show up do show up and the buttons 
I want to show up show up and do the thing I told it to, even if 
that is not doing the right thing. Also the way the program 
navigates through the Script.txt file is working quite well. I 
had a funny problem where it would just print p on start up 
because I had a place holder "Update" and the function was set 
to print the [1] of the arg because its usually a list of 
strings. Took me like 10 minutes to figure out ðŸ˜….

### Which goal(s) were you not able to acheieve? 
#### Please describe what problem(s) you faced, and indicate if you are still stuck on any particular step.
Getting arguments to the functions in the buttons in a clean way. I know I can do it by just having an arg in the Button class constructor but that feels gross idk why. Kind of a theme for this project has been always feeling like there's a better way to do something but not knowing how to do that thing.

### In a few sentences, descibe your next steps.
Get the buttons working.
