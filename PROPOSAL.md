### What is the title of your project?
Bankai

### In 3-5 sentences, summarize what you want to accomplish. Provide enough detail so that I can understand your main idea, but try to keep things concise.
Make a sort of turn based text/image game based on the manga Bleach. Mainly just use the characters and their moves to build the game, but it will be my own game. The user will play through one of the later arcs in the story fighting against the traitor Captain Aizen and his underlings. Could be a sort of rouge type thing where you have to do it in one shot or start over again. Going to use Pygame.

### In a numbered list, briefly describe your intermediate goal(s) (i.e., what you want to accomplish before Wednesday, January 12). 
1. User interface
2. Combat system layout(at least start)
3. Characters, names and pics
